<h1>Alarm Clock Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025-11-23</p>

<p>Alarm Clock is an offline alarm app. It keeps your data on your device and uses system permissions only to schedule alarms and optionally respect your calendar.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alarm settings (stored locally):</strong> alarm times, labels, repeat patterns, skip dates, snooze/vibration choices, ringtone selections, and calendar bypass rules are saved only in local app storage on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar data (optional):</strong> If you grant <code>READ_CALENDAR</code> and enable calendar bypass, the app reads your device calendars and upcoming events (title, start/end time, all-day flag, busy status) to decide whether to skip an alarm. Selected calendar IDs and event IDs may be stored locally to honor your preferences. Event details are not sent to any server.</li>
    <li><strong>No personal identifiers:</strong> The app does not collect or require account info, location, contacts, advertising IDs, analytics, or crash reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Network use:</strong> Network access is only used to check for Google Play in-app updates. No usage or personal data is sent to us.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Schedule and ring alarms at the times you configure.</li>
    <li>Send local notifications for alarms, snooze options, and “alarm skipped due to calendar” reminders.</li>
    <li>When enabled, compare your selected calendars to bypass alarms during conflicting events.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>READ_CALENDAR (optional):</strong> Needed only to read device calendars and events when you enable calendar-based bypassing.</li>
    <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To show alarm, snooze, and bypass notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM / USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT / FOREGROUND_SERVICE / FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK / VIBRATE / MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS:</strong> To schedule reliable alarms, play alarm audio, show the full-screen ringing UI, and control vibration/sound during alarms.</li>
    <li><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:</strong> To restore scheduled alarms after your device restarts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data. There are no third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. All alarm and calendar data stays on your device.</p>

<h2>Data Retention and Control</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All data is stored locally. Uninstalling the app or clearing its data removes your alarms and preferences.</li>
    <li>You can revoke calendar permission at any time in system settings; when revoked, the app stops reading calendars and clears cached calendar events on the next refresh.</li>
    <li>You can silence or disable notifications in system settings if you prefer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
<p>The app is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app. Material changes will be noted by updating the “Last updated” date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or requests, contact us at <a href="mailto:itsme.ronjie@example.com">your-email@example.com</a>. Replace this address with your preferred support email before publishing.</p>
